<!-- In the Keedy Lab, we are interested in the "secret lives" of protein structures:
how they move when we''re not looking,
how their motions contribute to biology,
and how they are regulated to control how proteins function in cells.

We use cutting-edge experiments in structural biology, especially X-ray crystallography,
combined with computational analysis of three-dimensional models,
to elucidate how proteins move and how that matters for biology.

<!-- ## What are the "secret lives" of protein structures?

<img src="/images/slide_alt_confs_density.jpg" height="300" align="right"/>
For protein molecules, structure is critical to function.
But proteins don't like to sit still!
The alternative conformations of proteins,
which are often overlooked by traditional structural biology methods,
can provide key insights into biological processes.
We are exploring new methods in X-ray crystallography for revealing
the **"hidden" conformational ensembles** of proteins
and incorporating them into new types of three-dimensional models.
Our goal is to develop new methods to
characterize excursions from the average structure in proteins
and to explore the implications of those excursions for biology.

<h2>Premature commitment to uncertain decisions</h2>

Making accurate decisions based on unreliable sensory evidence requires cognitive inference. 
Dysfunction of n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors impairs the integration of noisy input in theoretical models of neural circuits, 
but whether and how this synaptic alteration impairs human inference and confidence during uncertain decisions remains unknown. 
Here we use placebo-controlled infusions of ketamine to characterize the causal effect of human NMDA receptor hypofunction on cognitive inference and its neural correlates. 
At the behavioral level, ketamine triggers inference errors and elevated decision uncertainty. 
At the neural level, ketamine is associated with imbalanced coding of evidence and premature response preparation in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. 
Through computational modeling of inference and confidence, we propose that this specific pattern of behavioral and neural impairments reflects an early commitment to inaccurate decisions, 
which aims at resolving the abnormal uncertainty generated by NMDA receptor hypofunction.

<h2>Noisy learning</h2>

When learning the value of actions in volatile environments, 
humans often make seemingly irrational decisions that fail to maximize expected value. 
We reasoned that these 'non-greedy' decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, 
may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. 
Here using reinforcement learning models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, 
we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stem from this learning noise. 
The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on 
behavior could be predicted both by blood oxygen level-dependent responses to obtained 
rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and by phasic pupillary dilation, 
suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleusâ€“norepinephrine system. 
Together, these findings indicate that most behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.
